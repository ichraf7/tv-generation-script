# TV Script Generation

this project is part of deep learning nanodegree .

In this project, I generated my own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.or
/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.   Using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts
from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network that I build  generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
